Online Job Booking System using ASP.NET MVC
In this project, I created an online booking system for a voice over talent.  This website gives some descriptive information on the talent so potential clients can
better understand what kind of sound the talent offers.  There is also an About section with additional information where potential client can hear samples of the
talent's previous work.  In addition to a page with the talent's contact information, there is a Booking tab.  This is where clients can request the talent for future
recording projects.  This is also where the talent can see pending jobs they have.  

In future versions of this project, I'd like to get individual user authentication set up so clients can only see jobs they have booked while the talent can see any
pending jobs.  I'd also like to add functionality where the user can upload a copy of the script and project notes for the talent when they enter their request.  
Finally, I'd like to explore hosting options with Microsoft Azure.
